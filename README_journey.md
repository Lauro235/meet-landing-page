I'm coming back to this after some time away. I made some decisions which are frankly a bit baffling. There are unused variables which I don't think I'll need. After completing the project I'd like to look at cutting out all the unused code. Next steps are to build out the fundamental tablet design. I'm not worrying about hovers or extra css interactivity for now.

One question I have is how to manage height sensibly. I'm using a lot of padding-bottom to ensure good verticle spacing between components and sections, but I think it's messy and I wonder if there is a more stable way to manage vertical space.
